# Chess Game Design

## 1. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements:

The system must:
- render an 8Ã—8 chessboard.
- alternate turns between the two players (white and black).
- allow each piece to move according to the official chess rules.
- validate move legality and reject illegal moves.
- detect game-ending conditions (checkmate, stalemate, or draw).
- determine and announce the winner or a draw.
- provide the ability to start a new game.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

The system should:
- provide a user-friendly graphical interface for making moves and viewing the board.
- display visual indicators for legal moves, checks, and checkmates.
- respond to user actions (e.g. move selection) within 100 milliseconds.

## 2. Use Cases

**Title:** Start Game

**Primary Actor:** Player

**Success Scenario:** 

**1** Player launches the chess application.

**2** System initializes the game board with pieces in starting positions.

**3** System sets the current turn to Player. 

**4** System displays the board to the player.

**Title:** Make Move

**Primary Actor:** Player

**Success Scenario:** 

**1** Player selects a piece and a target square. 

**2** System highlights valid moves.

**3** Player confirms the move.

**4** System updates the board, moves the piece, and switches the turn to the other player.

**Title:** Validate Move

**Primary Actor:** Player

**Success Scenario:** 

**1** Player attempts a move. System checks if the move is valid based on piece type and game rules. 

**2** If valid, the move proceeds. If not, system notifies player and rejects move.

**Title:** Check Game Over

**Primary Actor:** Player

**Success Scenario:** 

**1** After each move, system evaluates the board state. 

**2** System checks for checkmate, stalemate, or draw conditions. 

**3** If the game is over, system displays result to players.

**Title:** Get Winner

**Primary Actor:** Player

**Success Scenario:** 

**1** At end of game, system determines if one player has checkmated the other or if the game is a draw. 

**2** System displays the winner or draw result.

**Title:**: Display Board

**Primary Actor:** Player

**Success Scenario:** 

**1** System continuously displays the current board state after each move.

**2** System highlights possible moves when a piece is selected and updates the display accordingly.
